Synacor challenge
===

This is my solution for the Synacor Challenge. I have written my implementation in C++ which I found very well suited for the task.

I have included my image for the virtual machine. If you are going to make your own, remember to check out your own image as it contains codes only associated with my user.

The Synacor Challenge can be found here: https://challenge.synacor.com/ . I can warmly recommend it - especially if you are missing the good old university days :) 

To compile and run just run `make` followed by `./vm`
